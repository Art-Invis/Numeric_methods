# Numerical Methods in Python üêç

This repository contains Python implementations of various **numerical methods**, which are essential for solving mathematical and computational problems in fields such as engineering, physics, and data science.

## üìö Features
- Implementation of key numerical methods:
  - **Gaussian Elimination** (with/without pivoting)
  - **Root-Finding Algorithms** (e.g., Bisection Method, Newton-Raphson Method, Secant Method)
  - **Numerical Integration** (e.g., Trapezoidal Rule, Simpson's Rule)
  - **Systems of Linear Equations** (e.g., Jacobi Method, Gauss-Seidel Method)
  - **Interpolation** (Lagrange, Newton Polynomial)
  - **Approximation and Fitting** (e.g., Least Squares Method)
- Well-documented code with explanations and comments.
- Easy-to-understand examples for each method.

## üõ† Technologies
- **Python 3.x**: Primary programming language.
- **Libraries**: 
  - [NumPy](https://numpy.org): For efficient array and matrix computations.
  - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) (optional): For visualizing results where applicable.

## üéØ Goals
- Serve as a learning resource for students studying numerical methods.
- Provide practical implementations of numerical algorithms in Python.
- Offer reusable code snippets for solving computational problems.
